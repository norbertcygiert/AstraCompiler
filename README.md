# Astra Compiler
## Compiler for a Swift-like language.<br>

## Motivation
Have you ever sat in your room thinking, "Yup, that's it, I'm writing my own compiler"?<br>
Me too! - And this is the effect.<br>
I was thinking for a long time and the choice is Rust - in my eyes a very promising language to learn. <br>
This project is an opportunity for me to learn Rust and Git usage at the same time, as well as prepare for internships and deepen the knowledge about compilers.

## Usage 
No usage for now. This project is deep, deep in the early phases of development.<br>
If you really want to see how the lexer works just copy the code and pass your expression in the main function in main.rs. 

## Roadmap 
<h4>(will probably be updated as development goes on)</h4>
1. Basic Lexer (done)<br>
2. Basic Parser (in development)<br>
3. Variables <br>
4. "if" statements and "while" loops<br>
5. Functions<br>
6. Maybe try transpiling to another language? <br>
Will also develop an intermediate represantation (IR) language somewhere along.
